Do you need help adjusting HTML or CSS? Then ask me or Oktavia, the original creator who inspired me to try this. Thanks to his advice, I have now found a nice hobby. So what are you waiting for? Let this be your adventure too! You can even get a secure domain from GitHub with SSL certification. And if you'd rather use your own domain, that's possible too! All you have to do is change your DNS settings to GitHub's IP address. It's an exciting journey building and customizing your website, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. So feel free to ask your questions and let's get started together to shape your digital world!
